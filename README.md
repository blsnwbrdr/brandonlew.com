A portfolio website with custom JavaScript code that includes connecting to ETSY's API; built to gather and randomize photos from my ETSY shop.

## Scripts

- `branch-clean-up` - After running `git fetch -p` to clean outdated remote branches, use this script to delete those branches locally.
- `build` - Builds `index.html` from `index-staging.html` and minifies the JS and CSS files.
- `sass-watch` - Starts the automated Gulp script that compiles Sass changes.
- `start` - Starts up the production and pre-prod environments locally and opens them in Chrome.
- `start-currency-local` - Starts up the currency-local server to build a local copy of `currencyData.json`.
