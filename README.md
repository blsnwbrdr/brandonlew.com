# Brandon Lew Photography

A responsive photography website that highlights the beautiful images. Viewers are directed to the various photos through the limited amount of text and lots of white space, as it helps keep the images as the focus. Bootstrap, flexbox, and media queries are used to keep the site responsive, so it looks great on different browsers and devices. The website also features a few Javascript and jQuery scripts to give it some modern functionality.
